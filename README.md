# Coordinate Update for CFN Model

This github repo contains code used to generate simulations for a research project on the CFN model.
The theoretical arguments are contained in a sequence of three papers:
* [Liklihood-based root state reconstruction of binary latent model on a tree: sensitivity to parameters and applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13208)
* [Likelihood landscape of binary latent model on a tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17622)
* **Published at ICML:** [Sample complexity of branch-length estimation by maximum likelihood](https://icml.cc/virtual/2025/poster/46053)
